"YC startups - where are they now?" - D3.js data visualization of 1,000+ YC startups across 7 years created with Python and BeautifulSoup.

## About

This project was a quick, fun exploration of D3.js. Using BeautifulSoup and Python, I scraped data from [YcList](http://yclist.com) to obtain 
7 years worth of data (1,000 startups) that attended [YC](http://ycombinator.com) between 2005 and 2012.

I categorised these startups into - % alive, % dead and % exited and saved these to a local CSV file.

I also developed a buzzword counter that classifies startups based on buzzwords e.g. '57 startups described themselves with the 
buzzword 'platform' and 31 desribed themselves with 'marketplace'. The ultimate goal was to correlate the use of buzzwords 
with likelihood of success (measured by % exited or % alive). I am yet to finish this.
